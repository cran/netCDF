This code requires the netCDF library and header files, which are
available from UCAR

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/

Debian users can install netcdfg and netcdfg-dev.

The Makefile assumes that libnetcdf and the headers are in the standard
search path, and may need editing. For example, on a Solaris machine this
will not find things in /usr/local
